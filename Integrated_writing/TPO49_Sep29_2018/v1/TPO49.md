In the reading passage, the author states that humpback whales may navigate by stars to migrate long distances. However, the professor refutes this idea and thinks the reasons listed in the reading are unconvincing.
 
First of all, the author claims that humpback whales are intelligent enough to navigate by stars, while the professor states that there is no correlation between intelligence and an animal's ability to use stars for navigation. For example, some birds such as ducks evolved the ability for navigation by stars. And ducks are only of general cognitive ability, not as advanced as humpback whales. So, it seems that there is no real connection between intelligence and the ability to use stars for navigation.
 
In addition, the author argues that humpback whales have no land features in the ocean to help them migrate in straight lines for long distance. So, they have to rely on stars. However, the professor challenges this statement by pointing out that the presence of biomagnetite in the brains of humpback whales enables them to be sensitive to Earth's magnetic field. It is Earth's magnetic field that helps humpback whales to migrate.
 
Finally, the professor cast doubt on what is stated in the reading that humpback whales look at the stars through spy-hopping, which is a rare behavior among marine animals. He claims that there is no connection between spy-hopping and looking at stars since other animals exhibit this behavior but do not migrate, such as sharks. Also, humpback whales do spy hop during the day when no stars can be seen in the sky. So, the statement that humpback whales adopt spy-hopping to look at stars is not convincing.
