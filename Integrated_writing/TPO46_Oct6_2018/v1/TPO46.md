The professor discusses the storage form of medical information about patients which differs from the main idea in the reading that storing patients' medical records in electronic databases does not actually have advantages stated over traditional paper-based record keeping in the reading.

To begin with, as the passage states, the use of electronic records can help reduce costs by saving money on storing and transferring medical records. While paper records require a significant amount of storage space, electronic medical records take up virtually no space. The professor argues that the costs savings are not as effectual as the reading suggests. He adds doctors almost keep the paper records as emergency backup while those who used to do the electronic records may cost additional storage and time to record the same medical information on paper.

On top of that, the reading passage claims that electronic medical records help a lot to reduce the chances of medical errors which are caused by illegible handwriting, improper transcription of data, and nonstandard organization of paper records. In contrast, the professor made the point that electronic medical records cannot eliminate the possibility of errors since the electronic records are often entered into computer by the office staff of the doctor according to the doctorâ€™s instant handwriting records.

Finally, the lecture is the opposite of the idea that medical research would necessarily benefit from electronic record keeping. The professor points out that access to all medical information is subject to strict privacy laws in the United States. Researchers who want to collect data from electronic medical records have to follow strict and complicated procedures and obtain much permission including patient permission along the way. Often such permission is not granted.
